# 🏛️ Apollos Finance
### The Autonomous Hedge Fund System

Welcome to the official home of **Apollos Finance**, a decentralized yield protocol built on **Arbitrum**. Apollos Finance pioneers the next generation of DeFi by integrating institutional-grade risk management with seamless cross-chain accessibility.

## 🌟 Our Vision

In the current DeFi landscape, liquidity providers are often caught between two fires: **Impermanent Loss (IL)** and **Loss-Versus-Rebalancing (LVR)**. Apollos Finance solves this through:

*   **Linearized Yield Strategies:** 2x leveraged vaults that neutralize price exposure, turning market volatility into pure yield.
*   **AI-Powered Protection:** Real-time LVR protection via **Chainlink Workflows** and **Uniswap V4 Hooks**, using **Gemini AI** to detect and block toxic flow.
*   **Unified Cross-Chain UX:** A "Store-and-Execute" architecture powered by **Chainlink CCIP** that makes multi-chain deposits as easy as a single click.

## 🏗️ The Modular Ecosystem

The Apollos Finance protocol is split into four specialized layers, each serving a critical role in our "Intelligence-Driven" architecture:

### 🔗 [apollos-sc](https://github.com/Apollos-Finance/apollos-sc) (The Core)
The decentralized heart of the protocol. Contains the **Hybrid ERC4626 Vaults**, the **CCIP Receiver** logic for cross-chain automation, and the **LVRHook** for Uniswap V4. Built with **Foundry** for maximum reliability and performance.

### 🛰️ [apollos-be](https://github.com/Apollos-Finance/apollos-be) (The Intelligence Hub)
A high-performance observability and monitoring layer. It bridges on-chain events with off-chain AI reasoning, providing **human-readable transparency logs** and real-time market divergence analysis.

### 🏛️ [apollos-fe](https://github.com/Apollos-Finance/apollos-fe) (The Command Center)
A sophisticated, high-fidelity dashboard built with **Next.js 15** and **Wagmi**. It provides users with deep insights into their positions, real-time yield charts, and a guided cross-chain bridging interface.
